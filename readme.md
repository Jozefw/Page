1. The Open Sans font did not render in Chrome with the same effect that Frutiger has in regards to spacing and font weight.
No style guide
Clicking into the text filed in the Photoshop comp converted the font to an alternative, creating a different layout.
Measurements made in Photoshop were not according to scale, even if dividing the pixels by 2, so I completed the task by eye.
SVG paths were damaged, or otherwise corrupted, or did not render corretly inthe HTML doc. The SVG image in chrome could be viewed alone, but not once embedded in in the HTML.
No mobile or tablet comps to determine the responsiveness direction.
Was uncertain how to wrap the icon-svgs in the second module....flex-box?
In the module/section witht the laptop, moving the laptop center on mobile washed out the font color.  The laptop is white with a black border, so either way (black or white colored font) part of the font would get washed out.
